# There should be one way to do something
A general idea of Ice is that there should be usually only one way to do something. This is not a hard rule, but a general principle.

For example, hexedecimal literals allow only uppercase letters as numbers, that is something like `0xFFFF` is valid, while `OxfFff` is not.
